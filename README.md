As part of my second year in my undergraduate degree, I developed and deployed a number of ARM assembly programs onto an ARM FPGA.

This involved a range of topics including I/O, interrupt requests, and supervisor calls.

The FPGA included I/O devices including 6 LEDs, an LCD screen, a keypad, and piezo-electric buzzer.

This repository outlines my experience in tackling programming in ARM assembly and concludes with a final project where I bring most of the concepts learnt together. This project also involved me writing some Verilog code and synthesising it onto the FPGA. The earlier work in `core_concepts` leaves a lot of my early mistakes on full display. I am by no means an expert in assembly coding, but I think it is clear to see some of my improvements when compared to the `final_project`.

I enjoyed programming at such a low level and especially tricks with bit manipulation. I look forward to leveraging these bit tricks specifically in my [larger personal project](https://github.com/cyrusknopf/yggrdasil): a C++ chess engine using bitboards.
